<p>Access types in Ada have been designed in a way to prevent the occurrence
of dangling references, i.e. they can never designate objects that have
gone out of scope. There remains however one problem: When <tt>Unchecked_Deallocation</tt>
is used in order to reclaim storage, we might access already freed storage
or, even worse, storage occupied by new objects of different types, unless
utmost care is taken (this is the very reason why the generic is called
<i>unchecked</i> deallocation). Thus in the following fragment (with a
suitable instantiation for <tt>Free</tt>), <tt>B.<b>all</b></tt> no longer
exists when it is referenced, but no exception is generally raised:</p>

<ul>
<pre>A, B: Some_Access_Type;
A := <b>new </b>Accessed_Object;
B := A;
Free (A);
... B.<b>all</b> ...</pre>
</ul>

<p>(Note however that <tt>A.<b>all</b></tt> would raise <tt>Constraint_Error</tt>.
<tt>B.<b>all</b></tt> might raise an exception; it depends on what it references
at the time.)</p>

<p>In Ada83, there was no way to prevent this in a safe way (since we had
no control about objects going out of scope, we could never know for sure
how many access objects were currently designating the same object), but
in Ada95 with the controlled types, we are able to provide an abstraction
of safe pointers for which dereferencing as in the example above will inevitably
raise <tt>Constraint_Error</tt>.</p>

<p>Ada2005 has brought further changes, the most important ones in this
context are the removal of return-by-reference functions and the possibility
to instantiate certain generics like our safe pointers in local contexts.
The former language change has necessitated a fundamental code change.
Hence both versions (Ada95 and Ada2005) are available. This text describes
the Ada2005 version; the original Ada95 version description is available as
a MS word document.</p>

<p>As we shall see, our safe pointers work like access types while keeping
track of all pointers to an object.<SUP><a href="#Garbage Collection">1</A></SUP>
So the maximum set of operations that we have to provide comprises:</p>

<ul>
<li>a null pointer (not designating anything) [<b><tt>null</tt></b>]</li>

<li>assignment (to both, pointers and referenced objects)</li>

<li>equality</li>

<li>allocation (with and without a value) [<b><tt>new</tt></b>]</li>

<li>deallocation [<tt>Unchecked_Deallocation</tt>]</li>

<li>dereferencing [<b><tt>all</tt></b>]</li>

<font COLOR="#888888"><li>referencing or aliasing [<tt>'[Unchecked_]Access</tt>] (removed, see below)</li></font>
</ul>

<p>Note however that Ada provides a plethora of type classes for which
some of the above operations do not exist: e.g. limited, private, definite,
indefinit types, and combinations thereof. So defining one root package
as a container for children providing safe pointer types for different
type classes is a good idea.</p>

<ul>
<pre><b>package <a name="Safe_Pointers"></a></b>Safe_Pointers <b>is
  pragma</b> Pure;
<b>end </b>Safe_Pointers;</pre>
</ul>

<p>We will now present a generic child unit providing a safe pointer type
designating objects of a definite type, i.e. of a type with the maximum
set of operations.</p>

<p>The idea behind the implementation is to allocate each object designated
by a safe pointer exactly once and to count all pointers designating the
same object. Only when this counter is zero can we finalize the pointer,
i.e. free all occupied storage.
(<a name="Text"></a>See <a href="Safe_Pointers-ads.html">specification</a>
and <a href="Safe_Pointers-adb.html">body</a>.)</p>

<p>We will show in a few examples how safe pointers work. For comparison,
the corresponding statements with access types are also given.</p>

<ul>
<pre>P, Q: Safe_Pointer;
A, B: Some_Access_Type;
... P = Q = Null_Pointer ...
... A = B = <b>null</b> ...</pre>
</ul>

<p>After their declaration (without an initial value), they both point
to nothing (the object with component
<tt><a href="Safe_Pointers-ads.html#Null_Track">Null_Track</a></tt>
returned by <tt><a href="Safe_Pointers-ads.html#Null_Pointer">Null_Pointer</a></tt>
in the case of <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Q</tt> and <b><tt>null</tt></b> in the
case of <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>).</p>

<ul>
<pre>Allocate (P);
A := <b>new </b>Accessed_Object;</pre>
</ul>

<p>The call of Allocate decreases the counter of the object designated
by <tt>P</tt> (currently there is none, so it is finalized) and creates
a new object and tracker; there is now one pointer to the new object.</p>

<ul>
<pre>Q := P;
A := B;</pre>
</ul>

<p>The assignment decreases the counter of (the object designated by) <tt>Q</tt>
(again there is none) and increases the counter of <tt>P</tt>; there are
now two pointers to the object.</p>

<ul>
<pre>Assign (P, Object);
... Value (P) = Value (Q) ...
... Value (P) = Object ...
A.<b>all </b>:= Accessed_Object;
... A.<b>all </b>= B.<b>all </b>...</pre>
</ul>

<p>The call of procedure <tt>Assign</tt> assigns a value to <tt>P</tt>.
Since <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Q</tt> designate the same object, dereferencing
either returns the given object. The same is of course true for <tt>A</tt>
and <tt>B</tt>.</p>

<font color="#888888">(Functionality removed, see below)
<ul>
<pre><b>declare
</b>  O: <b>aliased </b>Accessed_Object;
  R: Safe_Pointer;
<b>begin
</b>  Alias (R, O'Unchecked_Access);
  R := P;
<b>end</b>;</pre>
</ul>

<p><tt>R</tt> points to the aliased object <tt>O</tt>, the counter is one;
note that the <tt>'Unchecked_Access</tt> attribute has to be used because
of the accessibility rules. In the assignment, the counter is decremented
and <tt>R</tt> can be finalized - there is no pointer left designating
<tt>O</tt>. After the assignment, there are three pointers to the object
designated by <tt>P</tt>. When <tt>R</tt> leaves its scope, it is finalized
again, so two pointers remain.</p></font>

<p>So far we have seen nothing special about safe pointers. The big difference
from access types will be shown in a moment.</p>

<ul>
<pre>Deallocate (Q);
... Q = Null_Pointer ...
... P <font COLOR="#00CC00">=</font> Null_Pointer ...
... Q = P ...
... <font COLOR="#00CC00">Value (P)</font> ... -- <i>Constraint_Error
</i>... Value (Q) ... -- <i>Constraint_Error
</i>Free (A);
... A  = <b>null </b>...
... B <font COLOR="#FF0000">/=</font> <b>null </b>...
... A.<b>all </b>... -- <i>Constraint_Error
</i>... <font COLOR="#FF0000">B.<b>all</b></font><b> </b>... -- <i><font COLOR="#FF0000">no</font> Constraint_Error</i></pre>
</ul>

<p>This fragment deallocates the object designated by <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Q</tt>,
decreases the counter of <tt>Q</tt> (which is also the counter of <tt>P</tt>),
and sets <tt>Q</tt> to <tt>Null_Pointer</tt> (this leaves <tt>P</tt> unchanged).
Although the internal representations of <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Q</tt> are
now different, the equality operator will return <tt>True</tt> in all three
cases above, which is not the case for access types as shown. And also
other than with access types, dereferencing with either pointer (as well
as with <tt>A</tt>) will inevitably raise <tt>Constraint_Error</tt>, whereas
dereferencing with <tt>B</tt> will return the old object, although it no
longer exists. What still exists is the storage location where it had been
sitting and also the bit pattern at that place, so that <tt>B</tt>, ignorant
of the facts, interprets it in the usual way.</p>

<p>Since pointers do reference counting, deallocation is actually not needed.
Assignment of <tt>Null_Pointer</tt> or letting go pointers out of scope also
deallocates automatically the object as soon as the last pointer has
disappeared.
You can write a complete application without ever deallocating without
leaking storage.
<tt>Deallocate</tt> is simply provided because it also exists for access
types.</p>

<p>For each object created, a <a href="Safe_Pointers-ads.html#Track">tracker</a>
is created as well, which with each allocation or assignment operation
and also when a pointer is finalized updates the number of pointers designating
this object. The storage occupied by an object and its tracker are automatically
reclaimed if there is no pointer left designating this object after such
an operation.</p>

<p>Storage occupied by an object can also be deallocated explicitly. With
this operation, any other pointers designating this object are set to a
null value. Thus, if <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are pointers designating
the same object, erroneous access through <tt>Y</tt> after deallocation
of <tt>X</tt> is impossible. The exception <tt>Constraint_Error</tt> is
raised instead.</p>

<p>There is one problem with safe pointers that also haunts the Ada container
library: There is no way to write directly to components of composite objects in
a completely safe way; you must alway take a copy of the whole object, make the
assignment to the component, then store whole object again.</p>

<p>Thus Ada definitely needs a safe method to return references. There are some
deliberations in this vein in Ada Issue AI05-142, but whether this will make
it into the next revision and in which form, even the gods don't know.</p>

<p>A solution which comes near this goal is presented by the function
<tt>Reference</tt>. It returns an accessor of which only the discriminant is of
interest: It grants direct access to the object in a nearly uncompromisable
way.</p>

<ul><pre>
Reference (P).Value.C := X.C;
</pre></ul>

<p>where <tt>X</tt> is some object with a component <tt>C</tt>.
A reference object is limited so it cannot be copied - you can just
use it for dereferencing. Further while this reference exists, any attempt to
deallocate the referenced object (the Ada Reference Manual calls this
<i>tampering</i>) leads to <tt>Program_Error</tt>, so the reference cannot
become dangling. Lifetimes of such objects tend to be short.</p>

<ul><pre>
<b>declare</b>
  <font color="#00CC00">Ref: Accessor := Reference (P);  -- local store</font>
<b>begin</b>
  <font color="#00CC00">Ref.Value.C := X.C;</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">Deallocate (P);  -- Program_Error, Reference still exists!</font>
<b>exception</b>
  <b>when</b> Program_Error => <b>null</b>;
<b>end</b>;  <font color="#00CC00">-- Reference ceases to exist</font>
Deallocate (P);  <font color="#00CC00">-- OK</font>
</pre></ul>

<p>Lifetime is even shorter if you don't use a local store as above.
Here, the reference is finalized directly after the assignment:</p>

<ul><pre>
Reference  (P).Value.C := X.C;  -- Reference is finalized after assignment
Deallocate (P);                 -- no Program_Error
</pre></ul>

<p>In RM language (7.6.1(3/2)), <i>the assignment statement is the master
of the local reference object</i>.
(<i>Note:</i> GNAT GPL 2009 does not finalize, it needs a block as above;
GNAT GPL 2011 works correctly.)</p>

<p>You might think that also the following code shows tampering attempts:</p>

<ul><pre>
<b>declare</b>
  Ref: Accessor := Reference (P);
<b>begin</b>
  P := Null_Pointer;  -- tampering?
  Allocate (P);       -- tampering?
<b>end</b>;  -- Reference ceases to exist
</pre></ul>

<p>While the reference still exists, <tt>P</tt> stops pointing to the referenced
value.
While this is true, it's not really a problem, since the value still exists,
other than when deallocation is called, so you do not access a dangling pointer.
(The body of <tt>Allocate</tt> could easily be changed to also raise
<tt>Program_Error</tt> in this case, but I have not found a way to prevent the
assignment.
Consistency requires that either both, assignment and allocation, raise
<tt>Program_Error</tt> or none do.)</p>

<p>You are even safe against inadvertantly storing a copy of the discriminant
<tt>Value</tt> in an access type that has a longer lifetime.
Accessibility checks make the following program fragment illegal.
(<i>Note:</i> GNAT GPL 2009 still accepts this code; GNAT GPL 2011 works
correctly.)</p>

<ul><pre>
<b>declare
  type</b> Acc_Int <b>is access all</b> Integer;
  Named: Acc_Int;
  Anon : <b>access</b> Integer;
<b>begin</b>
  <font color="#FF0000">-- Value's accessibility level ist statically deeper than
  -- that of Named and Anon.</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">Named</font> := Acc_Int (Reference (P).<font color="#FF0000">Value</font>);  <font color="#FF0000">-- illegal!</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">Anon</font>  :=          Reference (P).<font color="#FF0000">Value</font> ;  <font color="#FF0000">-- illegal!</font>
<b>end</b>;
</pre></ul>

<p>I would also have liked to construct the type <tt>Accessor</tt> in such a
way that a declaration of an accessor object without initialization by a
call of <tt>Reference</tt> would have raised <tt>Program_Error</tt>, but I
didn't find a (satisfactory) way to do so. But also without this, such an
accessor object is harmless, because it is completely useless.</p>

<font color="#888888">
<p>(This is the reason why the aliasing functionality has been removed.
You can find the code still in the Ada 95 version.)
One severe error however remains possible:</p>

<ul>
<pre><b>declare
</b>  O: <b>aliased </b>Accessed_Object;
  R: Safe_Pointer;
<b>begin
</b>  Alias (R, O'Unchecked_Access);
  P := R;
<b>end</b>;  -- <i>out-of-scope O remains
</i>      -- <i>accessible via global P!</i></pre>
</ul>

<p>We can call this the <i>law of constant malice</i>. This happens because
we have to use the <tt>'Unchecked_Access</tt> attribute (RM 3.10.2). Inadvertant
use of the simple <tt>'Access</tt> attribute leads to a disastrous effect:</p>

<ul>
<pre><b>begin
  declare</b>
    O: <b>aliased </b>Accessed_Object;
    R: Safe_Pointer;
  <b>begin
    begin</b>
      Alias (R, O'Access);
    <b>exception
      when</b> Program_Error =&gt; <b>null</b>;
    <b>end</b>;
    R := Null_Pointer;
  <b>end</b>;
<b>exception
  when</b> Program_Error =&gt; <b>null</b>;
<b>end</b>;</pre>
</ul>

<p><tt>Program_Error</tt> is raised and the pointer's internal representation
is destroyed leading to complete chaos. We need a double block to cure
the situation!</p>

<p>As an excercise, the reader is invited to investigate what exactly happens.</p>
</font>

<p>So safe pointers clean up behind themselves properly; no dangling references
can ever be produced. The astute reader will however note that this does not
mean safety against storage leaks.
We can always create inaccessible islands, e.g. a ring of cyclically connected
objects that is not accessible from outside.</p>

<p>The really enthusiastic reader might care to construct child packages for
other type classes.</p>

<p>As a concluding example, the specification of a child package for safe
pointers on limited indefinite types is given. Only dereferencing
operations are available for such types. We cannot allocate an object without
giving an initial value, because the type has unknown discriminants - nor
can we allocate with an initial value, because assignment is not available.
So in fact, safe pointers behave exactly like access types for such types
- the whole package does not make much sense!</p>
